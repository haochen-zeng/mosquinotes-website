# 🦟 Mosquinotes

A shared notes repository that aims to provide a collaborative platform for individuals interested in sharing and accessing study notes.

## Install

To fully utilize the shared notes, it is recommended to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It allows you to view and create connections between the notes through links and more.

To clone or download the repository and add it as a vault in Obsidian, follow these steps:
1. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file. Alternatively, you can copy the repository's URL and use it for cloning by executing the command `git clone https://github.com/EXSPIRAVIT1104OFFICIAL/Mosquinotes.git`.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.
3. Open Obsidian on your computer.
4. Click on "Open folder as vault" in the Obsidian startup screen.
5. Browse and select the extracted the repository folder.
6. Obsidian will now display it as a vault. The [content](https://github.com/EXSPIRAVIT1104OFFICIAL/Mosquinotes/tree/main/content) folder contains all the text file contents.

## Update

To view the newest version of a repository, you can update your local copy by following a few steps:
1. Ensure that you are on the main branch by executing the command `git checkout main` (replace "main" with the appropriate branch name if necessary).
2. Fetch the latest changes using `git fetch`. This will update your local repository with the latest commits from the remote repository. However, it's important to note that if you have made local changes that haven't been committed or pushed yet, updating the repository could potentially overwrite your changes. To avoid this, it is recommended to commit or stash your local changes before updating.
3. Once you have updated the repository, you can view the updated files either by using `git log` to see the commit history or by navigating to the local repository directory to access the latest files.
